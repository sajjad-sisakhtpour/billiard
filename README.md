## Overview

This project demonstrates the mechanics of a billiard game, featuring realistic physics-based ball movement, collision detection, and user interaction with a virtual pool stick. It's intended as a portfolio sample to illustrate skills in game development and JavaScript programming.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- A local server to handle the `file://` limitations when loading assets, or run directly in a browser extension allowing local file access.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajjad-sisakhtpour/billiard.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd billiard
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the project using a local server (e.g., Python's `http.server`):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```

---

## Usage

- Use the mouse to aim and adjust the stick's rotation.
- Hold the left mouse button to charge power.
- Release the button to shoot.
